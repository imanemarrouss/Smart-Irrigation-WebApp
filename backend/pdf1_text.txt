Abstract: Water management is paramount in countries with water scarcity.
This also aﬀects
agriculture, as a large amount of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global
warming lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the availability
of water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed at saving water usage in the
irrigation process have increased over the years. Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation
systems are very expensive, making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of
system. However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected to
nodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture monitoring. Due to
the recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can be applied in the development of these
systems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart
irrigation systems. We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding
water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide an overview of
the most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the best
practices for the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.

1. Introduction
The lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly in the Mediterranean countries or southern
Asian countries such as India. Among the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the
most vulnerable to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and water
management. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such as the water demand
from the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees of warming on hydrological resources.
Climate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent topic in research papers regarding water resources and
agriculture. The possible consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating
water adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production and people and
to maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water to be consumed by humans and
to be returned to the environment must be ensured. The possible risks of climate change are an
increase in water shortage, the reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,
the biodiversity loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency and
remediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number of studies focused on
reducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of these studies suggest the implementation of

social, economic and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological innovations
to improve water management.
The agricultural sector is one of the most important economic resources in these countries
adding to the importance of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing
of this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered by rice plantations [3].
Furthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,
low food production aﬀects both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season
produced the least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss of rice production
due to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought caused by anomalies in surface water, the
Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the
information gathered from sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized
to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all the freshwater needs.
Countries with higher funds are already implementing systems for water management and water
reuse aiming to optimize water usage and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great
amounts of water. However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.
Commercial sensors for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,
making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their farms. However,
manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected to nodes to implement
low-cost systems for irrigation management and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the
interest in low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being
proposed in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level soil moisture
sensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5], a water salinity monitoring sensor
made with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters
and receptors [7].
Due to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems for agriculture
and the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied in the development of these
systems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart
irrigation systems. In this survey, we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research
regarding irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation
systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions, and fertilizer
usage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes and wireless technologies employed to
implement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the
best practices for the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.
Other authors have performed studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management
or precision agriculture systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems
analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis of the state
of the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation
such as software for irrigation systems [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation
systems for greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture [16–21], crop
monitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds of agriculture [23] that comment on
irrigation agriculture. In this survey, we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation
systems and the utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized
nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission of the data
gathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the current gap in literature with a
survey that provides an overview of IoT-based smart irrigation systems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology employed to
perform the survey. Section 3 presents the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the
parameters that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators. The sensors
and parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the evaluated smart irrigation systems
are depicted in Section 4. The most monitored weather parameters and the sensors that monitor

them are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized nodes for IoT and WSN
irrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication technologies and cloud platforms.
The discussion of the current trends regarding IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.
Lastly, the conclusion and future work are presented in Section 8.
2. Materials and Methods
In this section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform this study,
the following research questions were considered: What are the current IoT solutions for smart
irrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators, nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized
to develop IoT irrigation systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to
search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were obtained from Google
Scholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital library of Sensors [27]. The keywords
employed to obtain the total number of papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,
and smart irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the keywords
irrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.
In order to discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.
Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers were published from
the years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally, a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile
this review.
After the selection process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and
architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures in this paper but
discussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst group (160) were then analyzed to determine
the sensors and actuators that were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters
that were monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type of wireless
technology and data visualization technique that was utilized to access the data and to manually
choose the actions of the irrigation system. All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent
sections and converted into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of the
art regarding IoT irrigation systems.
The distribution of the papers regarding the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.
As it can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where agriculture
is a major economic source. India is the country with the highest number of papers with a total of
92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,
Indonesia Thailand, and the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that
have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.
It is remarkable that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area
(China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries of our survey
in terms of water management. India, which is the country with the highest production of papers
that presents IoT systems for water management is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.
With regard to the top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of
them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity problems. Again,
there are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their
agriculture and have published fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does
not mean that in these countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It is
possible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises and their ﬁndings are directly
patented and distributed in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from
developing countries.
As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has
been increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being
ﬁnished when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed
in 2019 had been published.

3. Water Management
In this section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent techniques
for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis, we consider the papers that include
any sort of water pumping actuator as an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,
107 of them present an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the ones that
just oﬀer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in this section.
In the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as irrigated agriculture, there
are diﬀerent manners to distribute the water. The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,
in some cases, a speciﬁc manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate
have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending to the way
of water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,
and (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation
without any consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled
irrigation, when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad
hoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast
majority of the papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042

in conjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters in order to calculate the water needs.
From the 89 evaluated papers in this section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation
system, the other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those 83
include diﬀerent levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only indicate that there are motor/pumps in
their system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers) without more detail. From those papers which oﬀer more
details, 19 of them include sprinklers (the most used system) [28–46], eight use drip irrigation [4,47–54],
two propose the utilization of sprayers [4,55], and the rest use a very speciﬁc irrigation systems
(robots [56], pivot [14], rain gun [57] or it can be applied to multiple systems [58]). In conjunction with
the principal irrigation system, three papers propose the use of a fogging system [41,43,51] and two
papers propose the use of fertigation in their systems [42,52].

In this paragraph, we describe the diﬀerent agriculture systems that are included in the papers.
Most of the included papers in this section do not describe the target agriculture system of their
proposal. Nevertheless, there are 38 papers that include this information, see Figure 4. The most
common use of irrigation systems is in outdoor agriculture, 50% of the proposed systems are for
outdoor agriculture. Among this outdoor agriculture cases [14,29,31,32,38,40,42,46–48,52,59–67], some
papers specify the agriculture products in more detail: general cereal [14], rice [48,59], spinach, beans,
carrots, walnuts, corn, barley and maize [47], and multi-height ﬁelds [60]. In addition, among the
14 papers about greenhouses [28,33,39,41,45,51,68–75], ﬁve of them specify the type of crop. There are
three cases of hydroponic crops [33,68,69], one case of mushroom cultivation [41] and one paper on
ﬂower farming [71]. Finally, there are ﬁve papers focused on gardening [36,53,55,67,76], one of them
speciﬁcally about green walls [76].

Following, we describe the sensors used in the irrigation systems. From a total of 89 papers that
include irrigation systems, there are six of them that do not describe or give information about the
utilized sensors for their system. Those six papers are more focused on the node, telecommunication or
visualization aspects. As in this survey we include several parameters, we will divide this information
into two ﬁgures.
In the ﬁrst graph, we are going to show what environments (air, water, soil or plant) have been
monitored in most papers. This information is presented in Figure 5. A paper that monitored the soil
can measure one or more parameters, but this information is not included in Figure 5. The environment
that has been monitored in more papers is the soil. It was measured in 76 papers, more than 85%
of the cases. Weather is the second parameter in terms of relevance of monitoring, it includes many
parameters such as temperature, rain, and humidity among others. Weather is monitored in 60 papers,
up to 68% of the proposals. Water is less measured in the proposals of irrigation systems. It is measured
only in 26 papers, less than 30% of the included cases. The plant monitoring is the less measured factor.
It is monitored only in four proposals. There are 15 papers that use the weather forecast to obtain data
and include this data in their system.

Monitored environments
Figure 5. Monitored environments in papers that propose an irrigation system.
Following, the details about the number of monitored parameters are presented (see Figure 6).
From the 89 included papers, more than half of the proposals measure between three and four
parameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one or two) represents 31% of the cases (17% one parameter
and 14% two parameters). There are some rare cases (10% of them) where more than four parameters
are monitored. The papers where more parameters are measured are [64,67], with six measured
parameters and [31,45,46,61,68,75,76] that measured ﬁve parameters. On the other hand, there are ﬁve
papers (6% of cases) that do not measure any parameter [33,41,77–79].
Next, the details about the measured parameters are shown. Regarding the sensors of soil, plants,
and water (see Figure 7), the most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76
papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil and plant sensors. The soil
temperature is much less considered in these systems, it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending
to the soil characteristics, in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the
soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include a pH sensor. However,
not all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],
only four of them indicate this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers
consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height [64,83], using an
ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness was considered in their system [46,84,85].

Now, the data from the water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the
commentaries not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the
information of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the irrigation
system. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out of 88 papers
that have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to monitor the water level in the tanks
and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in
one case [36], the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the case of
sensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun
dianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that
do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].
There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].
The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8 sensor (Gems
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
8 of 48
Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi
jishu youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors are based on a
Hall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8
can measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring
ﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do
not include actuators for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity
is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors indicate the used
sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and conductivity from B&C Electronics
(Carnate, Italy).
Additionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their
proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding the equipment used are
given. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].
In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).
The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one case [69] did the
authors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other
proposals evaluated in this survey (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature
sensors for the water.
On the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored the atmospheric parameter,
the data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation
systems. No details of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information
will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured parameter, it is
monitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a humidity sensor. Other parameters are less
measured such as the rain, which is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation
system, or the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that consider the
weather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the data from the forecast in conjunction
with the data gathered by sensors and ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information
for weather data/atmospheric parameters.

Figure 9. Number of included actuators in papers that propose an irrigation system.
The vast majority of the papers include only the actuator of the irrigation system (pump, valve,
sprinklers, etc.). A total of 71 proposals (81% of cases) use only the irrigation system as an actuator.
There are seven papers (8% of cases) that propose the use of two actuators (irrigation system plus
another one). The use of three actuators is presented in seven papers, the same percentage that the
use of two actuators. Finally, there are some rare cases (3%) where authors have proposed the use of
more than three actuators, in two papers they use four actuators [39,72], and in one case the use of ﬁve
actuators is presented [67].
Next, we present in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering only
the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.
Therefore, we do not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized actuator is
the sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as an alarm for the
farmers or as a dissuasive measure to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second
position, we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].
The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo- periods to increase
productivity, but they can also be used for operational purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals
and their use is related to modifying the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the
balance between CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The use
of ultrasonic sound emitter is found in four papers [32,51,64,65]. The least utilized actuators in IoT
irrigation systems are scarecrows [58,65,66], which are dummies or robots that are utilized or have
the function of scaring birds and other types of animals to protect the crops, and heaters [28,65], that
modify the temperature to improve the performance or the health of the crops.

In addition to the deﬁned parameters, which are measured in diﬀerent papers included in this
survey, there is an important parameter that is crucial for irrigation scheduling. This parameter
indicates the water loss due to the evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the stomata of
plants; it is known as evapotranspiration (ET). Several authors measured both terms—evaporation and
transpiration—separately, using diﬀerent sensors to obtain the ET data [104]. It also can be estimated
according to the vegetation and the climatic data by several mathematic models [105]. Some web-based
applications can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing is the
best option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities for ET monitoring with sensors,
the integration of soil moisture changes can oﬀer evaporation data. Nonetheless, the measurement of
transpiration is more complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,
leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its measurement, it is not
included as a monitored variable in most of the papers of precision agriculture. None of the papers
considered by this survey includes all the necessary sensors for measuring the ET.
4. Soil Monitoring
An outline of the soil parameters considered for the IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the
utilized sensors are detailed in this section. In this section, we include the data from those proposals
that include at least one sensor for the soil, a total of 106 papers are included.
As indicated in the previous section, the most relevant parameter for the irrigation systems is soil
moisture. The number of proposals that include diﬀerent sensors is presented in Figure 11. The soil
moisture is measured in all the 106 papers included in this section. The second parameter, in terms of
relevance, is the soil temperature. The soil temperature is monitored in nine proposals. The pH is
monitored in four papers [52,66,67,110] and the nutrients of soil in only three cases [5,80,102].

From the 106 proposals that include a soil moisture probe, 71 of them do not indicate the used
equipment to measure the soil moisture, see Figure 12. In six cases [38,101,111–114], they only include
a picture of the device, but they do not indicate the model and manufacturer. In all those cases, the
sensors employed are based on the measurement of the conductivity between two electrodes which
are inserted in the soil. In one case [94], the authors proposed to use a 4-fork sensor, based on the same
principle as the previous ones. Nonetheless, no extra information about the sensor used was included
in the paper, such as the manufacturer or model. The proposal presented in [98] only indicates that the
utilized sensor was manufactured by EB. In [64] the authors only mention that the sensor used was a
hygrometer. A total of 24 proposals clearly indicate the used sensor for monitoring the soil moisture.

used sensor, based on conductivity, is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been
used in nine proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price and it is
created speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes). The output voltage goes from 3.3
to 5 V and the output values are related to soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).
Nevertheless, it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture without
performing new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range of measure is found in the other
used sensor based on the same principle, the FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and
the SEN0114 (DFRobot, Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company
Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However, it is composed of three
electrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of
measuring the soil moisture giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed
in percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0 to 100% of relative
saturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.

A device able to measure the temperature and the moisture at the same time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,
Inc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120]. These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
12 of 48
85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated in its datasheet.
The operational principle of this sensor is based on the measurement of the dielectric constant of the
soil using transmission line techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding
soil salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output voltage is related to
the volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the
output voltage and the volumetric water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of
volumetric water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be implemented in
Arduino systems (and similar).
A sensor with completely different operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES
B.V., Delft, The Netherlands), is used in two proposals [14,121].
It is a solid-state electrical
resistance sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.
The 200SS has a pair of
highly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance of the sensor changes with the
soil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor
go from 0 to 199 centibars. The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the
plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able to measure two soil
parameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures the soil moisture and temperature based
on the generation and propagation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure
the soil moisture as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and the
accuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). This sensor
is not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be
adapted since the output voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.
Finally, the system detailed in [122] used the HA2002 sensor, but no information is available
on the internet about this sensor in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole
information that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan Dingrui
Electronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).
Regarding the sensors used for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,
45,54,63,67,94,122,123], the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that
do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate in the paper the
sensors selected. Although in one paper no information could be found about the sensor utilized [122],
the authors indicate that their system includes the HA2001 sensor.
In other cases, the information of the selected sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]
used an LM35 sensor. This device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to
+125 ◦C and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured by
Texas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40] selected the THERM200
(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the temperature. The operational range of these
sensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85 ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is
not speciﬁed in the datasheet.
In terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring
this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that
clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes an 1185 SunRom
color sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor is based on RGB color detection,
in [80] authors relate the color of the soil with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four
proposals [66,67,72,110]. However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment
in the paper.
5. Weather Monitoring
An overview of the weather parameters monitored in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the
most utilized sensors to monitor these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions
are a key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure 14 shows the most
monitored weather parameters in the currently available smart irrigation proposals. Temperature

and humidity aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned as the
thermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.
It is the most monitored weather parameter with one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the
presence of water vapor in the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).
It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore, luminosity is paired
with temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises the temperature and leads to more water loss in
the soil. It is deﬁned as the intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third most
monitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines whether the irrigation
is needed or not and the amount of water to be employed in the case of irrigation being necessary.
It considers any form of hydrometeor that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.
Furthermore, it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.
Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the most important factors
regarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many systems propose the monitoring of other
environmental parameters. Table 1 details all the papers that utilized these parameters.
Figure 14. Most monitored weather parameters.

As it can be seen, the four previously mentioned weather parameters are the most recurrent
environmental factors in the literature. However, there are other weather factors concerning the
air and climate that are monitored in some IoT smart irrigation systems. Ultraviolet radiation is
electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from 10 nm to 400 nm and is monitored by seven
papers [14,66,68,75,120,138,145]. Measuring wind speed [14,45,46,67,72], wind direction [45,46,67] and
atmospheric pressure [158] is also considered by some papers. Air pollutants are considered in some
IoT irrigation systems as well. CO2 [45,63,66,67,75,138,145], ozone [102], gas [95,143] and smoke [124]
are the types of air pollutant considered by the currently available smart irrigation systems. Lastly,
other parameters that are monitored concerning the surrounding area are movement and sound.
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042

Movement [38,42,58,61,65,127,141,143,146,148,163] and sound [42,138,140,163] are considered mostly
for security purposes. Ultrasound sensors are deployed to detect intruders in the ﬁelds.
There are varied sensors that can be utilized to measure weather parameters. However, there are
smart irrigation systems that opt for not including these sensors and choose to ask for the environmental
information to web servers such as Yahoo [62,127], that provide the weather and environmental data
from meteorology agencies.
Temperature monitoring is one of the most common parameters regarding weather monitoring in
IoT irrigation systems. As it can be seen in Figure 15, The DHT11 (Adafruit Industries, New York, NY,
USA), DHT22 (Adafruit Industries, New York, NY, USA) and the LM35 (Texas Instruments, Dallas,
TX, USA) are the most utilized temperature sensors with 27, 13 and 14 papers respectively. Al these
sensors are low-cost sensors. On the one hand, the DHT11 and DHT22 provide both temperature and
relative humidity readings. On the other hand, the LM35 and the TMP-36 (Analog Devices, Norwood,
MA, USA) have broader temperature ranges. The papers that utilized these sensors are detailed in
Table 2. These sensors are low-cost which may be relevant to their extended use.

According to sensor type, thermistors such as the DHT11, the DHT22 and the AM2315 (Adafruit
Industries, New York, NY, USA) are the most utilized type of temperature sensors, [14] (see Figure 16).
The DHT11 and DHT22 are low-cost sensors. However, the AM2315 has a higher price with the
advantages of a higher range (−40 ◦C to 125 ◦C) has higher accuracy (±0.1 ◦C). Semiconductor-based
integrated circuit temperature sensors like the LM35 (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA) and DS18B20
(Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA, USA) [50], and band-gap proportional to absolute temperature
sensors, SH10 (Sensirion AG, Staefa ZH, Switzerland) [35] and SH11 (Sensirion AG, Staefa ZH,
Switzerland) [46], are the next most utilized temperature sensors by type. The SH10 and SH11 sensors
provide both temperature and relative humidity readings. Furthermore, compared to the DHT11, they
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042

present better temperature ranges and accuracy. They are however similar to the DHT22 in terms of
temperature ranges, accuracy and price. The TMP36 (Analog Devices, Norwood, MA, USA) [34,152]
is a temperature sensor comprised of a diode and the EE160 (SENSOVANT, Paterna, Spain) [75] is a
resistive temperature detector sensor. The FM-KWS (Dongguan Holchan Electronics Technology Co.,
Ltd., Dongguan, China) [122] and the BME250 (Adafruit Industries, New York, NY, USA) [157] are of
an unknown type.
Figure 16. Most utilized temperature sensors by type.
The most utilized relative humidity monitoring sensors are presented in Figure 17.
As in
temperature monitoring, the DHT11 and DHT22 sensors are the most utilized ones, with 29 and
13 papers that use them, respectively. As both sensors are able to monitor both temperature and
humidity, most systems that utilize these sensors do not choose a separate sensor for each parameter.
There are sensors with better accuracy. However, IoT irrigation systems generally do not need the
highest accuracy levels available in the market. Table 3 presents the papers that utilize these sensors.

According to type (see Figure 18), the most utilized humidity sensors for IoT irrigation systems is
the capacitive humidity sensor, which are the DHT11, the DHT22, the AM2315 [14], the SH10 (Sensirion
AG, Staefa ZH, Switzerland) [35], the HIH 4000 series (Honeywell International Inc., Charlotte, NC,
USA) [98] and the HH10D [166]. The DHT22, AM2315, and SHT10 have the same range. However, the
AM2315 has higher accuracy (±2%) than that of the DHT22 and the SH10 (±5% and ±4.5% respectively).
Resistive humidity sensors are another one of the types of available humidity sensors, such as the
HR202 [48]. However, there are ﬁve humidity sensors employed for IoT irrigation systems that are
of an unknown type. They are the FM-KWS (Dongguan Holchan Electronics Technology Co., Ltd.,
Dongguan, China) [122], the BME280 (Bosch, Gerlingen, Germany) [157], the EE160 (SENSOVANT,
Paterna, Spain) [75], the HTU210 (Adafruit Industries, New York, NY, USA) [46], and the SY-HS-220
(SYHITECH, South Korea) [49].
Figure 18. Most utilized humidity sensors by type.
Light intensity and UV radiation are another set of parameters that are frequently monitored
in IoT irrigation systems. Figure 19 presents the most utilized sensors for light intensity monitoring.
The light dependent resistor (LDR) is the most utilized sensor for light intensity monitoring [28,48,72,
76,84,119,129,131]. The second most used luminosity sensor is the BH1750 (ROHM Apollo Co., Ltd.,
Fukuoka, Japan) [62,126,146,157] followed by the TSL2561 (TAOS Inc, Plano, Texas, USA) [145,158]
with one paper less. The LS-BTA Vernier (Vernier, Beaverton, OR, USA) was used as well in [98].
Among them, the BHT1750 is the sensor with a broader range (1-65535 Lux). There is not a commonly
utilized sensor for radiation, but the sensors currently utilized in IoT irrigation management systems
are the SN-500 (Vernier, Beaverton, OR, USA) [14], the GUVA-S12SD (ROITHNER LaserTechnik,
Vienna, Austria) [120], the 6450 TSR (Davis Instruments Corporation, Hayward, CA, USA) [145] and
the SP110 [75].

Figure 19. Most utilized luminosity sensors.
Regarding rain, one of the ways in which it is incorporated in the decision-making process
of irrigation systems is to stop automatic irrigation if rain is detected to avoid overwatering [42].
The RSM3ALS sensor was utilized in [119]. It is an optical rain sensor comprised of an LED, an LRD,
an electronic control unit, lenses and an ambient light sensor. When the sensitive area is dry, a high
intensity of light is received by the IR receiver. When the sensitive area is wet, the intensity of the
received IR light decreases. It is manufactured by Bosch (BOSCH, Gerlingen, Germany) and it is
commonly used in the automotive industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured
by Sparkfun (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and
direction and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting board
with two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital and an analog output [48].
The operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the
YL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa, Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite
plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between the lines connected to
the ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.
The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning weather
is greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is the sanitation of the air of the
greenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants. This is then closely related to the activation
of the actuators necessary to the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect
the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64]. In the context
of agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use of sensors that can be low-cost sensors
such as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,
China), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather
stations. The MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring, and
the MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG), are the most utilized low-cost
sensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131 is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and
the MQ9 is utilized for CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].
Another sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device Private
Limited, Ajmer, India) [145].
Wind speed and direction may be of interest to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal
in [46], that utilized the SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of
interest as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].
Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring animals to
avoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection is a passive infrared (PIR)
sensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared light that radiates around the objects placed at the
front of the sensor. The change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger
the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic sensors are often utilized
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
18 of 48
to detect movement, such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare the
animals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter and a receiver that
operate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was
utilized in [60] to repel the animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some
systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133] is able to even detect the
type of insect pests that are damaging the crops. These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to
generate an alarm when intruders or animals are detected [61].
Depending on the type of agriculture, the values from the measures for each environmental
parameter can be utilized to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a
model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the data on temperature,
humidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler
and water pumps. Many IoT irrigation systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control
irrigation. In [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the irrigation
can be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset value is utilized at the beginning.
Then, the data is analyzed to determine the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to
modify the conditions of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and
intruders are presented in Figure 20.
Figure 20. Most utilized actuators.
Buzzers are the most utilized actuators in IoT irrigation systems regarding external agents. These
sound emitters are usually utilized to scare animals and to alert the user of anomalies in the system
or the intrusion of animals or people [32,49,58,59,61,66,91,95,103]. Fans [39,65,68,72,75,152,166] and
artiﬁcial lighting [39,51,71,72,75,82,154] are tied in ﬁrst place with seven papers each. The fans can
be utilized to cool the temperatures and to create a breeze or light wind to aid in the pollination
process. Artiﬁcial light is utilized to aid plants in performing photosynthesis. Diﬀerent colors may
be good for diﬀerent aspects of the plant growth such as blue for the leaves and a mix of red and
blue for the ﬂowers. Coolers are the third most employed actuator for weather conditions controlling,
utilized for cooling the temperature and for aiding in the control of the relative humidity, with four
papers [28,39,68,72]. The least utilized actuators in IoT irrigation systems are heaters [28,65], that
modify the temperature to improve the performance or the health of the crops. Most of the actuators
regarding weather conditions are usually placed inside greenhouses. Whereas buzzers and scarecrows
can be placed in outdoor ﬁelds.

Some other popular boards are manufactured by other companies but can be programmed utilizing

with four papers and three papers, respectively (see Figure 23). They are followed by the Raspberry Pi
3 Model B [132,151], the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B [76,117] and the Raspberry Zero [152]. There were
however eight papers that utilized an unspeciﬁed Raspberry Pi 3 [28,46,55,99,110,148,159,163] and
13 papers [39,50,59,65,96,115,120,124,134–136,172,178] that indicated that a Raspberry Pi node was
utilized but the model of the node was not speciﬁed. The Raspberry Pi boards are more potent than
the Arduino boards. Oftentimes, both Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards are utilized to implement an
IoT irrigation system, using them according to the processing requirements of each task.

The selection of the best node for an IoT irrigation system will depend on the necessities and
the characteristics the farmer wants for the system. Arduino nodes and similar nodes from other
brands provide a low-cost solution that can be implemented in developing countries and smaller farms.
On the other hand, Raspberries have powerful computing abilities that allow the implementation of
more demanding software and algorithms.
Many works do not use a microcontroller board like the ones presented above and opt to
implement their system with their circuit design. Figure 24 presents the most utilized processors for
smart irrigation systems.
The most utilized controllers are the ATmega328 [93,103,170,181,182]
(Atmel, San José, California, USA) and the ATmega2560 [56,72,81] with ﬁve and three papers
respectively.
The Atmega1281 [133,157] and the LPC2148 (NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven,
The Netherlands) [48,123] are both utilized in two papers each. The other controllers comprise
the LPC2138 [80], ATmega8 [101], the ATmega16/32 [65], the MSP430F5438A (Texas Instruments,
Dallas, Texas, USA) [67], the MSP430F5419A [179], the MSP430F2274 [179], the STM32L151CB
(STMicroelectronics, Geneva, Switzerland) [78], the STM32F205 [152] and the PIC16F877A (Microchip
Technology Inc. (Microchip Technology), Chandler, AZ, USA) [42]. The proposals that opt for
developing their own designs for the nodes aim at addressing their own particular requirements.
Therefore, the selection of the processor would depend on the characteristics of the IoT irrigation
system considering the type of crop and its irrigation needs.

6.2. Communication Technologies
In this subsection, an overview of the most employed wireless communication technologies is
going to be presented as well.
According to the Machina research report, the number of connected agricultural devices is
expected to grow from 13 million at the end of 2014 to 225 million by 2024 [183]. In addition, the
report predicts that around half of those connections will use the newly emerging low power wide area
network technologies which are particularly well suited to many of the applications in agriculture.
When IoT devices are implemented, the employed communication technologies are a key point to
achieve successful operation. In a generic way, communication technologies can be classiﬁed according
to the environment where they will be deployed, the utilized communication standard or the utilized
spectrum band. Table 5 shows the main technologies used in IoT for irrigation systems.

If the scenario is considered, they can be classiﬁed into two types depending on the purpose of
the IoT devices. On the one hand, we can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit
small amounts of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,
there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances that have high energy
consumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy consumption are some of the most important
aspects to consider when deciding which technology to use.
If the utilized standard is considered, there are a large number of wireless standards that are used
in the communications of IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices
that communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards usually reach
distances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards reach distances of kilometers.
Also, another type of classiﬁcation can be established based on the employed communication
technology. In this way, three categories can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that
connect utilizing Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those
that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed by those that connect
using both low power WiFi and WAN technology.
If the spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that use the
unlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands are known as Industrial,
Scientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International
Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according
to the region and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main drawbacks are
related to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The licensed spectrum bands are assigned
according to the diﬀerent proprietary technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and
fewer interferences. However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.
The most utilized communication technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in
Table 6. In many of the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication
technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common for authors to
start using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect the sensors with the nodes, and then, use
a wireless technology to send data from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.

According to the descriptions provided by the diﬀerent authors of their own implementations,
we have veriﬁed that the most used communication technology in the diﬀerent proposals is WiFi,
as it can be seen in Figure 25. The reason could be due to is accessibility. The currently available
low-cost devices for IoT usually support WiFi and, although its range can be considered short for
the average expanse of a farm, small farms could be able to provide enough wireless coverage with
several low-cost devices. GSM and ZigBee are widely spread wireless technologies as well, with 25
and 23 papers that use them respectively. GSM provides long-range communication at the cost of a
mobile plan of the service provider that operates in the area. ZigBee provides low energy consumption

and allows implementing networks with up to 65000 nodes. However, it has lower data rates than
other available technologies and its range would imply the deployment of many nodes. Lastly, there
are two new technologies that have been getting popular recently. LoRa is able to provide very long
ranges, which makes this technology a very good option for secluded areas with no service. Moreover,
regarding speciﬁc protocols for IoT systems, it is a little bit surprising that even though MQTT is
a widely spread protocol due to its low power consumption and low overhead, it is not a popular
protocol for IoT irrigation systems at the moment. It is observed that a relatively high number of
papers, exactly in 24 papers, did not describe the employed technology. In Figure 25 this group has
been named as Undeﬁned.
Figure 25. Communication technologies employed to implement IoT irrigation systems.
We also observe that, in a large number of works, the end-users access the data, obtained during
the monitoring process or to carry out the control of the system, through APPs or WEBs. Most of these
communications are done through mobile devices using wireless technologies.
Table 7 presents the communication modules that have been used in the reviewed articles.
It is observed that most of the authors have not indicated the communication module employed.
Furthermore, it can be observed that the most utilized module is the ES8266 WiFi module (SparkFun
Electronics, Boulder, CO, USA) with 29 papers. It is followed by the SIM900 GSM module (SIMCOM
Wireless Solutions, Shanghai, China ) with nine papers and the NRF24L01 2.4 GHz module (Longruner,
Shenzhen, China), the XBee S2 ZigBee module (Digi International Worldwide Headquarters, Hopkins,

6.3. Cloud Platforms
In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent cloud systems for IoT in smart irrigation
solutions is going to be discussed. The two main storage systems used by the authors are traditional
databases or cloud. In one article, the authors indicate that they store the data in a Raspberry Pi [124].
As it can be seen in Figure 26, a large percentage of the authors, more than 50%, have not deﬁned the
storage system they have used, there are 79 other papers where the storage system used is not speciﬁed.

To be able to provide the new services that are currently demanded in IoT, it is necessary to
use middleware. Through middleware, it is possible to connect programs that initially had not been
developed to be connected to each other. Bandyopadhyay et al. [199] presented a classiﬁcation of the
IoT-middleware, based on the various features and interface protocol support. One of the reasons why
middleware is needed to connect IoT devices, which are initially autonomous, is to provide cloud
services. We can take advantage of existing middleware using it on diﬀerent cloud platforms.
When we talk about the cloud, we identify a place where data, which is collected through sensors
and transmitted to remote locations, will be stored and processed. In most of the articles, it is indicated
that the data is processed in the cloud itself, and the end-users view all the information by connecting
to the cloud. Cloud storage has been done on diﬀerent platforms as it can be seen in Figure 27. In 24 of
the reviewed articles, the authors speciﬁed that they store the monitored data in the cloud, but do not
identify the utilized cloud platform (see Table 8). Most of the works in which the authors deﬁne the
employed cloud platform, the utilized platform is Thingspeak (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA),
with 14 papers. This platform is very intuitive and provides both free and paid options for storing,
analyzing and displaying the data on diﬀerent devices. Algorithms can be developed using MATLAB
(The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) to generate alerts. However, there are proposals that use other
cloud platforms such as FIWARE (FIWARE Foundation, Berlin, Germany) [75,149] and Dynamo DB
(Amazon DynamoDB, Seattle, WA, USA) [117,159] with two papers each, and MongoDB (MongoDB

Firebase (Firebase, San Francisco, CA, USA) [154], InﬂuxDB (InﬂuxData, San Francisco, CA, USA) [176].
These less-used platforms are either more expensive, provide fewer services or are less intuitive than
Thingspeak. Table 4 lists the cloud platforms that have been used in the reviewed articles.

7. Discussion
In this section, current trends regarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to
be presented.
7.1. Big Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization
IoT systems, in general, generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters
in real-time, and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary to provide
mechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment on the need for sustainable
management of big data to avoid overusing natural resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices
with solar energy, selecting useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing
clustering techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient algorithms
and the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to the components that are employed
nowadays are some of the suggestions they provide.
Although the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source of information, the analysis
of this data is paramount to optimize the IoT irrigation system according to the crop and the weather
conditions. For this purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers
in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity, variety, veracity,
and value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to
identify the irrigation practices performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content
to detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers. This information was
coupled with data on the weather conditions and other aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with
the cultivation risks of each type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently
being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for agriculture.
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology most companies are interested in for
various purposes. In the case of irrigation, the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available
resources such as water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as the
presence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and fruits. One of the techniques
employed to analyze the data gathered from the sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation
systems is fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses
and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100]. The fuzzy rules were
provided according to the water availability utilizing the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,
Wellington, New Zealand). Another fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage
error for the resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed [96].
The system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration of the irrigation process
once the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold. Light and temperature lead to the least
accuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy
from 62 to 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important sensor to
determine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162] as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy
interference system (ANFIS) to predict the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented
employing the MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid the
evaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative learning control (ILC) arithmetic
to make decisions regarding the opening of the water valves [67].
Machine learning is another technique that is utilized in irrigation systems to perform predictions.
The prediction algorithm in [120] for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction
techniques can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation such as the case
of [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for that purpose. Water usage is predicted as
well in [50] employing regression algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of
the environment and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized
by the user through a mobile app.
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042

Feedforward neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to
develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent and variable
learning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict soil moisture and they determined
that the latter was the best one. Furthermore, a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as
to perform predictions on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques
were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba plantations. The authors
conclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted
regression trees was the best regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.
The authors suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots as some
conﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such as organic ones. Furthermore, the
models considerably reduced their accuracy when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,
the authors state that the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it
substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.
7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors
As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more eﬀort to researching
IoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,
most of the solutions for irrigation management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so
as to increase the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual
sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation and agriculture speciﬁc
IoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,
Spain) [136]. It can be connected to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector
(SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector, digital
and analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York, NY, USA) and an antenna
connector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation of low-cost smart irrigation systems.
7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems
Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there is a need for
alternative means of powering up the devices that conform the system. Even irrigation systems with
access to the power grid may only receive power during a constrained time period. In India, for
example, the system presented in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on
the irrigation motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity happens
at irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present in the ﬁeld. To address the
need for alternative ways of powering the irrigation systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to
access the power grid, many systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system
more sustainable [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which is
an advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.
Considering those reasons,
a total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar energy to power their proposed irrigation
system [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].
7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition
The frequency at which the parameters are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time
monitoring [31,71] has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices
for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals decide not to
monitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption. Some authors have decided
to take a measure every 10 s [58].
7.5. New Forms of Data Acquisition
The advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining the data from the sensors deployed
in the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
32 of 48
Drones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other ways such as aerial images
of the ﬁelds.
Another new form of data acquisition is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and
actuators to perform activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring the
animals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas due to their ability to travel to
the desired location [38]. This robot is able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors
to avoid collisions. The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore, the
wireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring sensors and performs
tasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the
navigation of the robots for irrigation, the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path
planning (CPP) algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The robot
operating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of the robot which is divided into
three layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second
layer performs the communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs the
decision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as a linear shower. Furthermore,
these robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66] to provide them with more autonomy.
7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation
Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of the IoT system
is carried out, securing the system may become a challenging task as diﬀerent types of threats must be
considered. On the one hand, all the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation
system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing IoT describes the security
challenges that IoT irrigation systems may face. For example, organizations such as the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors
such as Garcia-Morchon et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and
managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things, malicious substitution
of things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private
information, routing attack, elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS
attacks, Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation system from
DoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected data or the system with the intention of
damaging the crops.
In order to face the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures, but
as new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies such as analyzing the
business impact of the attack, assessing the threats considering their impact and probability, its impact
on the privacy of the collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.
However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies on securing
IoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which aspects of IoT security are prioritized
for this type of system.
Jimenez et al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater puriﬁcation
system for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security threats [206], the authors of [207]
contemplate physical attacks that the IoT deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected
from the weather and possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions
such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being damaged or lost.
Furthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators when they are performing their
activities or be the aim of a person with malicious intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed
on the ﬁeld is the possibility of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with
access to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious code and false
data injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks
are aimed at depleting the battery of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks
as well. Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the deployed
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
33 of 48
devices. The concern of securing the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems
incorporating PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals, and
to alert of their presence [59,208].
Privacy is another aspect to consider. The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as
much privacy as the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact, Jimenez
et al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data of some irrigation IoT systems to
remain private, but the correct performance of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS
attacks. However, the owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to
remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical infrastructure
as the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that water would be consumed by people.
Therefore, considering this aspect, Ahad et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user
privacy, as the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel of the
farm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because of the need for guaranteeing
the ownership of the data to avoid repudiation and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]
remark on the burden that could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured
by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to perform physical attacks.
Lastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need for a secure storage system for the information,
with particular emphasis on distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead
to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].
As cloud computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services may
compromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud malware injection are some
of the attacks that can be intentionally executed to compromise the data and the performance of the
cloud [210].
Ransomware is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture [209].
All the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be encrypted until a ransom is paid.
For this reason, having a back-up in a remote location is greatly advised.
Barreto et al. [209] also remark some security threats that are not usually commented on when
discussing the security of IoT systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be
caused by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide login information
to people posing as technicians or click on malicious links on their e-mails. The other threats are
agroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential
information regarding aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.
Blockchain is a new technique that is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows
secure data storage and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply
chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse [212] or to secure
the overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,
blockchain has been applied in [214] to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed
smart watering system.
7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture
In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems is going to
be discussed.
Multi-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions for irrigation management [175,180].
These types of architectures make a distinction among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.
Typically, the distinction is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed
in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker for those lower in the
hierarchy [175].
Most architectures are divided into layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to
be carried out [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized in most of the
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
34 of 48
available architecture designs for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements
of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications, and security.
IoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment to perform multiple
activities such as detection, monitoring, control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that allow
their connection with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through
diﬀerent sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent actuators. Then, it
is necessary to transmit the monitored data and response actions between the devices. Communication
protocols are used for this task. In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working
together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery, device control
or the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may be necessary as well. The applications allow
the interaction of the user with the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize
the information, both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have been
processed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he considers appropriate to the
situation presented by the data, the actions can also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing
security to the system may also be considered.
Traditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are
the perception, network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the
network and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,
is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, authors
such as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: things,
edge, communication, and cloud. In these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer
to locate critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated by [216], cloud
(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage, HMI interfaces or analytic applications.
Figure 29 shows an image where one can see the architecture models.

Figure 29. Evolution of the layered model in IoT architecture.
In the case of the reviewed IoT systems for irrigation, both 3-layered [46,83,118,217,218] and
5-layered architectures [180] are available. Commonly, the lower layer is comprised of the sensor nodes
and the actuators. The middle layer is comprised of a gateway and contemplates data transmission.
Lastly, the third layer is usually tasked with performing data storage and analysis. Typical third layers
are conformed of cloud services, databases or applications.
A novel take on IoT deployments for precision agriculture is being considered on the Internet
of Underground Things [219]. The authors deﬁne the functionalities as in-situ sensing, wireless
communication in underground environments and the connection between the elements of the
architecture such as sensors, machinery or the cloud. For the case of IoUT, the sensors are deployed
underground. The authors performed a study on wireless communication among above ground and
underground devices. The path loss link between above ground and underground devices reached
−80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately 10 m for
−80 dBm. The authors also comment on the eﬀects of soil moisture on path loss.

7.8. Recommendations for the Implementation of a Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture
In this subsection, we present an architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for irrigation.
In order to ensure the correct performance of the IoT irrigation system for precision agriculture, the
architecture should provide interoperability, scalability, security, availability, and resiliency.
After having carried out an exhaustive study of works presented by other researchers, our
architecture proposal is divided into four layers that we deﬁne as devices, communication, services,
and application, as shown in Figure 30. Furthermore, the aspects related to management and security
should be treated jointly between the communication and services layers.
 
Figure 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.
The ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the functions of detection,
monitoring, control, and action are located. We would have four types of nodes. The water monitoring
node would monitor water quality to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.
The soil monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters that
aid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring node would measure air
temperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity, radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in
the decision making process. Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the
decision-making process.
The second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks. The Hop-to-Hop
communication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies and to transmit the frames that
contain the data of the device layer. From this block the frames will be sent to the network communication
block, to reach the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh
networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible for delivering
the capabilities of the transport and application layers of the TCP/IP model when communication
crosses diﬀerent network environments. Finally, the network communication block is responsible for
the communication (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using
the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it will be responsible for
managing the QoS.
The next layer is the services layer, which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes
the IoT services and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs the
assignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available resources. At last,
in business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling and execution of service block will be invoked
from the execution of the applications.
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
36 of 48
There are two blocks, management and security, that act on both the previously described
communication and services layers. The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,
accounting, performance, security (FCAPS) model and framework.
This is a model of the ISO
Telecommunications Management Network [220].
The security block guarantees both the security and privacy of the systems and is comprised
of four blocks. The authentication block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.
The authorization block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions will
be made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management block is used to achieve
secure communications between peers. Finally, the trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring
the user and calculating the level of trust of the service.
The last layer is the application layer. It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this
layer, users can receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators or
actions that have not been programmed automatically.
7.9. Future Challenges of IoT Irrigation Systems
The Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new view of the IoT [221].
It consists of
deploying both underground and above ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves
with underground-underground, underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground
communication. It is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture IoT
systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers and it would
reduce the amount of physical damage the nodes deployed on the ﬁelds may receive. Although WiFi
surprisingly allows underground-above ground communication in short distances and depths above
30 cm [222], it would be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the
creation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit the information through
the soil medium.
The use of LoRa is increasing for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its
long-range, which allows wireless communication to remote ﬁelds. However, the advances in 5G may
lead to a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one hand, if the designed irrigation system
produces lower amounts of data, as these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa
presents itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems that require the
transmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the problem of the limited amount of data that
LoRa can transmit. Considering these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid
wireless networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223].
There are diverse opinions on the existence and eﬀects of climate change on earth. However,
there is no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing
their awareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only aﬀects their view on the energy
consumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the origin of the components of the devices and the
impact of IoT devices on the environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. Therefore,
the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods will continue to be
a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to ﬁnd new materials that are weather-resistant
and do not increase severely the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable materials in some of the
elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].
As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated into most
IoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision agriculture. These technologies
provide not only increased security but also optimization to the management of the IoT systems.
This will lead to an increased understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically
modiﬁed crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will aid in optimizing
and reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms that are being proposed to
determine if treated wastewater can be used for irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with
wastewater depending on its composition.
Sensors 2020, 20, 1042
37 of 48
Lastly, farmers usually have a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable
to them. Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should have a
decreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial future.
8. Conclusions and Future Work
Water management is paramount in countries with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as
a large amount of water is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led
to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability of water for
food production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water usage reduction for irrigation have
increased over the years. In this paper, we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art
regarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to
characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have also identiﬁed the most
utilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for the irrigation of crops and the most popular
wireless technologies. Furthermore, the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop
management and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture
proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.
As future work, we are developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to
irrigation based on the proposed architecture.
